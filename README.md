# Software Development Exercises - UE01  

## 📜 Tasks  
This exercise focuses on designing algorithms using flowcharts and testing them with desk tests. The tasks include:  

### 1. Sinus Approximation  
Calculate an approximation of the sine of an angle between 0° and 180° using Bhaskara's formula.  
- **Materials:** [UE01_A1.pdf](./diagrams/UE01_A1.pdf)

### 2. Bus Ticket Price  
Calculate the ticket price based on the number of zones traveled, considering a maximum price limit.  
- **Materials:** [UE01_A2.pdf](./diagrams/UE01_A2.pdf)
